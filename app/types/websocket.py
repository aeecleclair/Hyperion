        Initialize the ConnectionManager.

        The ConnectionManager is responsible for multiple rooms. A room is a set of connected websocket over which messages can be broadcasted.

        When using multiple Hyperion workers, a websocket may be open with any worker.
        To be able to broadcast messages to all connected websocket, we need to send it to all open websocket from all workers.

        To do this, the class use a broadcaster.

        When a message must be send to a room:
         - the worker send the message to its connected websocket
         - the worker transmit the message over broadcaster
         - all workers will receive the message from the broadcaster and send it to its connected websocket


        You must configure a Redis server to use this feature.
        Without Redis, a memory broadcaster is used, which should not work with multiple workers.
