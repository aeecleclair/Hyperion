## Typing stubs for redis

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `redis` package. It
can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`redis`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/redis. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `9cd20ce0953a535d36e40f51588fc9f5a245629b`.
